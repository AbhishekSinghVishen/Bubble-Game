# Bubble-Game
 I've built the frontend using HTML and CSS, with JavaScript handling the game events. In the game, players aim to burst a specified number of balloons, and upon successful bursting, their score increases. The game runs for a duration of 60 seconds, after which a "Game Over" message is displayed along with the user's final score.
